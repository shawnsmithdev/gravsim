package main

// planets don't shoot back, but are massive and must be shot or avoided

// boxen shoot only if player is directly in front of them at short range

// ufos do a linear prediction shot at medium range

// motherships have multiple turrets that use both strategies and have large laser cannons

// mimics mirrors the player ships movements; a planet must be used to defeat it
